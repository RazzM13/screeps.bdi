# A collection of BDI-based intelligent agents for the Screeps game.

During a job application, I was requested to provide an AI solution for the [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) game that would be able to reach RCL 4 level and, in order to accomplish this goal, I went for an [intelligent agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent) approach, based on a rudimentary [BDI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93intention_software_model); this repository contains my specific implementation.

Please note that this is WIP, quite unfinished / unstable and with a few known bugs, no warranties provided whatsoever ... so please feel free to get inspired / use at your own risk :)
